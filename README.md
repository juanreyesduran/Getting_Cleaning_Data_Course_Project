# Getting_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

- Download the dataset 
- Load the activity and feature info and loads both the training and test datasets
- Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
- Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
